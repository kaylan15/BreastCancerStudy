    <h1>Breast Cancer Survival Study</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
    <p> Amidst rapid globalization in today’s world, the need for processing and interpreting biological data has also skyrocketed. More specifically,
        cancer (or oncology) research is a popular area of study, with significant funding being provided by the government, charities, and other corporations 
        in the private sector. In 2020 alone, breast cancer became the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with over 2.2 million new cases being reported. 
        Furthermore, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, about 1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. 
        Although breast cancer can also affect men, it is more prevalent in women, making early detection and awareness crucial for increasing survival rates and reducing 
        mortality rates. Considering the effects of genetics, lifestyle choices, early and/or late onset, and other demographics (such as race, age, and marital status), 
        research in the following field can provide a plethora of insight regarding disease development, potential options for treatments, and methods to prevent the onset of 
        cancer in the first place. Over the years, significant advancements in medical research have led to better treatment options, but challenges remain, particularly in 
        lower-income regions where access to early screening and healthcare services is limited. By studying the potential risk factors associated with breast cancer, the main goal 
        of our project is to provide different populations with the information they need to reduce their risk, and understanding the trends presented through data analysis 
        (which can lead to future projects of interest).</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>
    <p>
    The dataset, titled <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer" target="_blank">“Breast Cancer”</a> and obtained from Kaggle, 
    includes approximately 4024 rows of breast cancer-related information, with each feature representing a different aspect that may have an effect on breast cancer diagnosis and survival.

    <h3>Survival by Grade and Race</h3>
<div class="center">
    <iframe src="avg_survival_by_grade_race_heatmap.html" width="80%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>
    The interactive heatmap for survival, race, and grade provides valuable insights into the relationship between these variables and the survival outcomes of 
    breast cancer patients. By visualizing how survival months correlate with different races and grades, potential trends in the survival outcomes based on the 
    severity of the cancer (as indicated by grade) and racial groups can be observed. For instance, the heatmap might reveal that patients with higher-grade cancers 
    tend to have shorter survival times, while differences in survival could emerge across racial groups, possibly reflecting variations in access to healthcare, 
    genetic factors, or other socio-economic influences. The interactivity allows users to filter by grade or race, enabling a deeper exploration of these patterns, 
    and could highlight outliers or clusters that require further investigation. Based on the visualization provided, it is evident that a majority of patients 
    (diagnosed with breast cancer in grades 1, 2, or 3) have higher survival rates (ranging from 60 to 70 months after diagnosis). Furthermore, discrepancies begin 
    to appear in grade 4 data, where patients that do not identify as black or white only report about 0 survival months. The significant difference in data is 
    followed by white patients surviving nearly 67 months, while black patients survive for approximately 49 months after diagnosis. These findings may prompt 
    further clinical research into the impact of race and grade on survival, in order to develop more personalized forms of treatment for patients.

  <h3>Survival Months by Stage</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="image">

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>This line plot illustrates the average survival months for patients with breast cancer at different stages, as categorized in the dataset 
            (IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC). The x-axis represents the cancer stage, while the y-axis shows the average number of months patients survived after diagnosis. 
            The height of each point reflects the average survival time for that specific stage, and lines are used to show the difference in survival time between each stage, 
            since cancer progresses linearly. The chart shows that as the cancer progresses, the average survival time consistently begins to decline.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Survival Months by Race</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <iframe src="survival_months_by_race.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

            <p>More information about survival by race can be detailed here...</p>
        </div>          
    </div>

    <h3>Case by Race</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="image">
        <iframe src="cases_by_race.svg" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>This bar chart represents the total number of breast cancer cases categorized by race. The x-axis indicates the race categories (White, Other, and Black) while the y-axis 
            shows the total number of cases. This visualization shows a significant disparity in the distribution of cases among racial groups, with white people comprising the 
            majority of recorded cases in this dataset. However, it is important to consider external factors such as where the data was collected and the race distribution in that 
            area, healthcare access, and other factors that may influence this distribution. It is a bad conclusion to say that white people are more susceptible to breast cancer, 
            as previously mentioned, the data collected on race may be skewed.</p>
    </div>          
</div>


    <h3>Distribution of Regional Nodes Examined and Positive by Grade</h3></h3>
<div class="center">
    <iframe src="dist_reg_nodes_examined_pos_grade_boxplot.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<p>
    The interactive box plot comparing regional nodes examined and regional nodes positive across different grades provides significant insights into how lymph node 
    involvement relates to tumor grade. Based on the box plot provided, the presence of a greater number of examined regional nodes (for grades 2 and 3) is fairly evident, 
    followed by the presence of less than 30 nodes (for both examined and positive) for grade 4 anaplastic. These findings were unexpected, considering the medians for 
    regional examined and regional positive nodes hovered around 12-14 and 1-2 respectively (indicating the central tendency of distribution amongst patients diagnosed 
    with the following grades of breast cancer). However, an outlier of 47 is observed for an anaplastic grade 4 regional examined node, indicating that the increased
    presence of regional positive nodes does not necessarily correlate to higher grades. The following can further be explored via the interactive nature of the plot, 
    which allows the user to hover over individual data points. These findings can help inform clinical decision-making, emphasizing the importance of thorough lymph 
    node examination in higher-grade cancers and highlighting the role of lymph node positivity as a potential prognostic factor.

    <h3>Summary and Additional Work</h3>
    <p>Upon conducting a detailed analysis of the breast cancer dataset obtained, the following conclusions can potentially be drawn: (1) age is a significant factor that 
            determines the diagnosis, or early and/or late onset of breast cancer, (2) different stages of cancer are equally fatal and do not drastically reduce the number of 
            months that a patient can survive for, (3) black populations may potentially face a slight disadvantage of being able to survive only for a few more months, while 
            other races may face a notable disadvantage of surviving no additional months under grade 4 breast cancer, (4) patients that identify as ‘white’ are more susceptible 
            to being diagnosed with breast cancer, and last but not least, (5) breast cancer statistics are extremely distinct when considering multiple demographics and scientific 
            attributes. As a result of the current findings obtained from the following data visualization project, future work may involve creating interactive dashboards that allow 
            users to filter by factors like age, region, or cancer stage. Additionally, geospatial mapping could be used to show how incidence rates vary by location, and linking 
            this with access to healthcare services could help identify disparities. Moreover, visualizing risk factors like genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposure could 
            provide insights into their role in breast cancer trends, along with working towards making breast cancer information more accessible to the general public.</p>
