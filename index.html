    <h1> Breast Cancer Surival Study</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p> Amidst rapid globalization in today’s world, the need for processing and interpreting biological data has also skyrocketed. More specifically,
        cancer (or oncology) research is a popular area of study, with significant funding being provided by the government, charities, and other corporations 
        in the private sector. In 2020 alone, breast cancer became the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with over 2.2 million new cases being reported. 
        Furthermore, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, about 1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. 
        Although breast cancer can also affect men, it is more prevalent in women, making early detection and awareness crucial for increasing survival rates and reducing 
        mortality rates. Considering the effects of genetics, lifestyle choices, early and/or late onset, and other demographics (such as race, age, and marital status), 
        research in the following field can provide a plethora of insight regarding disease development, potential options for treatments, and methods to prevent the onset of 
        cancer in the first place. Over the years, significant advancements in medical research have led to better treatment options, but challenges remain, particularly in 
        lower-income regions where access to early screening and healthcare services is limited. By studying the potential risk factors associated with breast cancer, the main goal 
        of our project is to provide different populations with the information they need to reduce their risk, and understanding the trends presented through data analysis 
        (which can lead to future projects of interest).</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> The dataset, titled “Breast Cancer” and obtained from Kaggle, includes approximately 4024 rows of breast cancer related information, 
        with each feature representing a different aspect that may have an effect on breast cancer diagnosis and survival. Additionally, 
        the data set contains 16 distinct attributes, which include:</p>

            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
