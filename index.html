    <h1> Breast Cancer Surival Study</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p> Amidst rapid globalization in today’s world, the need for processing and interpreting biological data has also skyrocketed. More specifically,
        cancer (or oncology) research is a popular area of study, with significant funding being provided by the government, charities, and other corporations 
        in the private sector. In 2020 alone, breast cancer became the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with over 2.2 million new cases being reported. 
        Furthermore, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, about 1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. 
        Although breast cancer can also affect men, it is more prevalent in women, making early detection and awareness crucial for increasing survival rates and reducing 
        mortality rates. Considering the effects of genetics, lifestyle choices, early and/or late onset, and other demographics (such as race, age, and marital status), 
        research in the following field can provide a plethora of insight regarding disease development, potential options for treatments, and methods to prevent the onset of 
        cancer in the first place. Over the years, significant advancements in medical research have led to better treatment options, but challenges remain, particularly in 
        lower-income regions where access to early screening and healthcare services is limited. By studying the potential risk factors associated with breast cancer, the main goal 
        of our project is to provide different populations with the information they need to reduce their risk, and understanding the trends presented through data analysis 
        (which can lead to future projects of interest).</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> The dataset, titled “Breast Cancer” and obtained from Kaggle, includes approximately 4024 rows of breast cancer related information, 
        with each feature representing a different aspect that may have an effect on breast cancer diagnosis and survival. Additionally, 
        the data set contains 16 distinct attributes, which include:</p>

            <p>
                The interactive heatmap for survival, race, and grade provides valuable insights into the relationship between these variables and the survival outcomes of 
                breast cancer patients. By visualizing how survival months correlate with different races and grades, potential trends in the survival outcomes based on the 
                severity of the cancer (as indicated by grade) and racial groups can be observed. For instance, the heatmap might reveal that patients with higher-grade cancers 
                tend to have shorter survival times, while differences in survival could emerge across racial groups, possibly reflecting variations in access to healthcare, 
                genetic factors, or other socio-economic influences. The interactivity allows users to filter by grade or race, enabling a deeper exploration of these patterns, 
                and could highlight outliers or clusters that require further investigation. Based on the visualization provided, it is evident that a majority of patients 
                (diagnosed with breast cancer in grades 1, 2, or 3) have higher survival rates (ranging from 60 to 70 months after diagnosis). Furthermore, discrepancies begin 
                to appear in grade 4 data, where patients that do not identify as black or white only report about 0 survival months. The significant difference in data is 
                followed by white patients surviving nearly 67 months, while black patients survive for approximately 49 months after diagnosis. These findings may prompt 
                further clinical research into the impact of race and grade on survival, in order to develop more personalized forms of treatment for patients.

        <h3>Interactive Boxplot</h3>

        <p>
            The interactive box plot comparing regional nodes examined and regional nodes positive across different grades provides significant insights into how lymph node 
            involvement relates to tumor grade. Based on the box plot provided, the presence of a greater number of examined regional nodes (for grades 2 and 3) is fairly evident, 
            followed by the presence of less than 30 nodes (for both examined and positive) for grade 4 anaplastic. These findings were unexpected, considering the medians for 
            regional examined and regional positive nodes hovered around 12-14 and 1-2 respectively (indicating the central tendency of distribution amongst patients diagnosed 
            with the following grades of breast cancer). However, an outlier of 47 is observed for an anaplastic grade 4 regional examined node, indicating that the increased
            presence of regional positive nodes do not necessarily correlate to higher grades. The following can further be explored via the interactive nature of the plot, 
            which allows the user to hover over individual data points. These findings can help inform clinical decision-making, emphasizing the importance of thorough lymph 
            node examination in higher-grade cancers and highlighting the role of lymph node positivity as a potential prognostic factor.

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
